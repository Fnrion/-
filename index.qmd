##### *在基础次元的瞳实野市，作为一名穿越后的决斗者，你既没有社长的逆天财力，又没有卡片精灵的眷顾，更没有炫酷的发型、D轮或是紧身衣；同时面对即将到来的栗子杯庆典，你需要使用手头仅有的钻石购买大师包和初始自带的支援卡搭建你的构筑*

##### *In the city of Domushi located in the foundational dimension, as a duelist who has traveled through time, you neither have the president's incredible financial resources, nor the favor of card spirits, nor cool hairstyles, D-Wheels, or tight clothing. Meanwhile, facing the upcoming Chestnut Cup celebration, you need to use the only diamonds you have to buy master packs and the support cards that came with your initial setup to build your deck.*
